theme is from 
https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io


use  _data/navigation.yml to edit the navigation bar 	

use file example_paper_data_file.md for the original template for papers. but the idea is you structure the data then publish accordingly. 

Each publication will follow format set out in 
/_includes/archive-published-paper.html

if it doesnt include venue it will break. AND YOU NEED THE PAPER URL ASL WELL UGH

in general use single quotes for YAML table info (what is used to form the paper info)

YOU CANNOT USE HTML COMMENTS TO COMMENT OUT YAML THINGS, YOU NEED THE POUND SIGN
