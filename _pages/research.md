# Job Market Paper
[The Dose Response of Criminal Groups: Effects on Homicides and School Dropout](https://ignacio-rh.github.io/portfolio/2023-08-01-jmp)

Working Paper. [Link](https://ignacio-rh.github.io/files/ignacio_rodriguez_mexico_crime_jmp.pdf)

I study the impact of the number of Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) on homicides and school dropout in Mexican municipalities between 2006 and 2018. I find that as DTOs increase, there is a significant increase in homicides. Having 8 DTOs, the largest amount observed in my data, causes a 16-fold increase in homicides relative to the overall mean. Moreover, the relationship is increasing and convex, contrary to popular models of crime. Additionally, I find increased DTOs also increase local school dropout in middle school. These effects are concentrated amongst older and male students. I find no effects for younger or female students. The gendered and age-differentiated results suggest a recruitment channel from the DTOs, who rely on adolescent males for their workforce. Consistent with this mechanism, I find that as DTOs increase in number, the number of adolescent crimes with middle-school dropouts as perpetrators increase.

[COVID-19, Job Loss, and Intimate Partner Violence in Peru](https://ignacio-rh.github.io/publication/2022-08-01-edcc_ipv_peru)
With Jorge Agüero, Erica Field and Javier Romero

_Accepted._ Economic Development and Cultural Change. [EDCC link](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/727536) [Working Paper Version](https://ignacio-rh.github.io/files/edcc_ipv_peru.pdf)

Using variation in job loss for different occupations in Perú, we find households with worse employment shocks experienced important decreases in income and increases in intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We document these households also had worse mental health outcomes during this time.

[Is Remote Sensing Data Useful for Studying the Association between Pandemic-Related Changes in Economic Activity and Intimate Partner Violence?](https://ignacio-rh.github.io/publication/2022-05-01-pnp-remote-sensing-IPV2)

With Jorge Agüero, Erica Field and Javier Romero

_Published_ AEA Papers and Proceedings. [Link](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20221014)

Nightlight and NO2 measures correctly predict short-run changes in income during the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote sensing data do not find any corresponding change in intimate partner violence (IPV). Households' occupational sector strongly predicts both income and IPV. Remote sensing data are useful when studying changes in income during the pandemic, but may be inappropriate when studying behavioral responses like IPV.

[International evidence to inform decision making on implementing urgent response social protection measures](https://ignacio-rh.github.io/publication/cash_grants)

With Kate Orkin, Robert Garlickm Marta Grabowska, Brynde Kreft and Alice Cahill

_Published_ Psychology, Health & Medicine . [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2022.2108088)

This paper summarises evidence from a rapid review of international findings on the effects of cash transfers. The learnings were used to inform the design of urgent response social protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The summary demonstrates that in response to widespread disruption, cash transfers have broad benefits for children, adults, and the wider economy.
