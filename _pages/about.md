Welcome to my website! I am an applied microeconomist working at the interesection of crime and development economics. For my job market paper I study how the presence of large Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) impact both homicides and middle school dropout. More broadly, I am interested in studying how crime in the developing world impact individual and household behavior. 

I am on the job market for the 2023-24 academic year.
