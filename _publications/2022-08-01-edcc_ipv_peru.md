We document these households also had worse mental health outcomes during this time.'

_Abstract_ A large literature has explored the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on intimate partner violence (IPV) worldwide. However, few studies provide clear evidence on the mechanisms through which the pandemic exacerbated violence and many rely on hot- line or police report data, which confounds changes in reporting behavior. Our paper addresses this issue by conducting a large nationwide survey in Peru, a country that has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. We isolate pandemic-related economic shocks based on geographic variation in the industry composition of employment shocks, and find a sizable and sustained increase in IPV, which aligns with the patterns found in helpline calls. Households most likely to lose a job experienced the largest increases in IPV. These patterns indicate that economic losses were an integral causal mechanism through which COVID-19 increased IPV.
