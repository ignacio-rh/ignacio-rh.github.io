excerpt: Nightlight and NO2 measures correctly predict short-run changes in income during the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote sensing data do not find any corresponding change in intimate partner violence (IPV). Occupational sector strongly predicts both income and IPV. Remote sensing data are useful when studying changes in income during the pandemic, but may be inappropriate when studying behavioral responses like IPV.

_Abstract_ Using a survey conducted in Peru, we explore the use of remote sensing data in predicting income and intimate partner violence (IPV). We find that remote sensing measures correctly predict short-run changes in income during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the remote sensing data fail to explain any corresponding change in IPV. In contrast, using individualized information from our survey, we find that negative economic shocks result in higher levels of IPV. We conclude that remote sensing data may be useful when studying changes in income during the pandemic, but may be inappropriate when studying behavioral responses like IPV.
