__Summary__: We find that nightlight and NO2 measures correctly predict short-run changes in income during the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote sensing data do not find any corresponding change in intimate partner violence (IPV). The household's occupational sector strongly predicts both income and IPV. Remote sensing data is useful when studying changes in income during the pandemic, but may be inappropriate when studying behavioral responses like IPV.
